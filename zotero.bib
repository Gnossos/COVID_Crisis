This is not something I do frequently in my workflow, so I do the usual sequence of finding the appropriate help page: ?interpolate Help pages: stats::approx Interpolation Functions stats::NLSstClosestX Inverse Interpolation stats::spline Interpolating Splines So, the help tells me to use approx() to perform linear interpolation. This is an interesting function, because the help page also describes approxfun() that does the same thing as approx(), except that approxfun() returns a function that does the interpolation, whilst approx() returns the interpolated values...},
